I’m a software architect and developer with long experience in fintech, insurance, and systems that have to behave
predictably. I work mostly with Java, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, distributed systems, and the surrounding infrastructure,
but don't shy away from any tech stack.
My focus is on building solutions that are easy to reason about, maintainable, and practical in real environments.

I also run a homelab where I test ideas before they reach production. It includes Proxmox, containers, Kubernetes,
storage setups, networking experiments, and various tools I use to understand how things behave under real conditions.
It also includes many services I use for consuming all kinds of media.
It’s where I validate assumptions, try new approaches, and document the results.

Outside my main job, I build side projects: internal tools, small SaaS products, and automation systems. Many of them
solve problems I’ve run into myself - data ingestion, search, RAG pipelines, workflow automation, or simplifying
day-to-day engineering work.

This site collects what I’ve learned, things I’ve built, notes from troubleshooting, and documentation I want to keep in
one place. It also serves as a snapshot of my experience so I can refer back to it in the future. Over the last 20
years, I've done so much with computers and technology that I'm sure I've forgotten a lot of interesting bits.

A large portion of my computing experience is logged over at my [blog](https://chilyashev.com).
